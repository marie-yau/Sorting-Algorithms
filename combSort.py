# Comb Sort is an improvement of Bubble Sort which compares two adjacent numbers in every iteration through list.
# Comb Sort compares two numbers across specified gap. It starts with a large gap and shrinks the gap after every
# iteration through the list. The optimal shrink factor was found experimentally and it is 1.3.
# It improves performance on the worst case of Bubble Sort - having small numbers at the end of the list. Having
# gap larger than one requires less comparisons than when the gap is 1.
#
# Time Complexity: Worst-Case O(n^2), Best-Case O(n*log(n))
# Space Complexity: O(1), In-Place
# Stability: Stable
